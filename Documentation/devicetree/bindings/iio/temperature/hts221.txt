* STMicroelectronics HTS221 capacitive digital sensor for relative humidity and temperature

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "st,hts221-humid"
  - reg: Should contain the ADC I2C address

Optional properties:
  - poll_interval: Set the polling interval. It can be 1 Hz, 7 Hz or 12.5 Hz
    every other value will be parsed to one of these frequences. Value is given
    in msec, so 1 Hz = 1000 ms
  - h_resolution: Select the numbers of averaged humidity samples. The Values
    can be 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512. The higher the value, the higher
    the accuracy but the higher the current too.
  - t_resolution: Select the numbers of averaged temperature samples. The Values
    can be 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. The higher the value, the higher
    the accuracy but the higher the current too.

Example:
i2c4: hts221@5f {
		compatible = "st,hts221-humid";
		reg = <0x5f>;
		poll_interval = <100>;
		h_resolution = <32>;
		t_resolution = <16>;
	};
