Device-Tree bindings for TI WL12xx Chip

Required properties:
- compatible : can be "ti,wl1271", "ti,wl1273", "ti,wl1281", "ti,wl1283".
- reg : Should be <X>, according to which registers within the silicon block
        the device uses.
- interrupts : <a> where a is the interrupt number for the port.
- interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that services
		     interrupts for this device.
- ref-clock-frequency: The clock reference frequency of the chip in Hz.

example:
	wlcore: wlcore@2 {
		compatible = "ti,wl1271";
		reg = <2>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio3>;
		interrupts = <28 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>; /* gpio 92 */
		ref-clock-frequency = <38400000>;
	};
