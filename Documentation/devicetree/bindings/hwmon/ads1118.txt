ADS1118 (SPI)

The ADS1118 is 16-bit analog to digital converter with 4 inputs and a
temperature sensor.
The ADS1018 is a 12-bit version of the chip.

The inputs can be single ended or differential pair combinations.

Each channel, 0 - 4 may be configured as a single ended adc input.
Channel 0 may be configured differentially with channel 1.
Channels 0, 1, or 2 may be configured differentially with channel 3.

To set up a differential pair, the lower channel should be have
the ti,differential-endpoint property set to the higher channel in the pair.

Each channel can be configured individually:
 - fullscale voltage range values are +/- microvolts
    6144000, 4096000, 2048000, 1024000, 512000, or 256000

 - data_rate in samples per second
    - for the ads1018:
      128, 250, 490, 920, 1600, 2400, or 3300
    - for the ads1118:
      8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 250, or 860

The sensor contains an internal pullup register to keep the data output
high when not in use. This may be disabled, but is enabled by default.

1) The /ads1118 node

  Required properties:

   - compatible : must be "ti,ads1018" or "ti,ads1118"
   - spi-cpha : spi phase set to 1 (spi polarity is 0)
   - reg : the spi chipselect address
   - #address-cells : must be <1>
   - #size-cells : must be <0>

  Optional properties:

   - ti,tempsensor: enable the temperature sensor
   - ti,pullup-disable: disable the internal pullup resistor

  The node contains child nodes for each channel that the platform uses.

2) channel nodes

  Required properties:

   - reg : the channel number (0, 1, 2, or 3)

  Optional properties:

   - ti,differential-endpoint: differential second endpoint.
   - ti,fullscale: fullscale range in +/- microvolts
   - ti,datarate : the converter data rate in samples / second

  Example ADS1118 node:

	ads1118@0 {
		compatible = "ti,ads1118";
		spi-max-frequency = <2450000>;
		reg = <0>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		ti,tempsensor;
		voltage0@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			ti,fullscale = <6144000>;
			ti,datarate = <860>;
			ti,differential-endpoint = <1>;
		};
		voltage1@3 {
			reg = <3>;
			ti,fullscale = <6144000>;
			ti,datarate = <475>;
		};
	};

For the above example, The temperature sensor is enabled as well as
channels 0 and 1 in differential mode, and channel 3 single ended.
