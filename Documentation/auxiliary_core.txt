Auxiliary Core Sysfs Interface for Userspace
=============================================

This file describes how you can use the auxiliary core from the Userspace.


Paths in Sysfs
--------------
There are three kinds of entry in /sys/devices/system/cpu/aux_core:

   -	Control interfaces used to get userspace control over auxiliary core;

   -	The file/programm which you want to start in the auxiliary core; and

   -	the address were the file should be loaded (default is tcm).

The control interfaces have the following read/write attributes:

    /sys/devices/system/cpu/aux_core

    	"bootaux" ... read:
		  you will get the status of the clock, and the status of
		  the core.
		  Example:  "cat bootaux" will give you the Status of the
		  auxiliary core.

		  ... write:
		  you can write several commands to the bootaux file:
		  pause: this will disable the auxiliary core clock so the
		         programm which is running will be paused.
		  start: this will enable the auxiliary core clock so the
		         programm which is paused will be continued.
		  stop:  this will disable the auxiliary core itself and the
		         clock.
		  reset: this will hold the auxiliary core in reset so you
		         can download a new programm to the auxiliary core
		  run:   this will start the auxiliary core at the address
		         which is given in the variable mem_addr.
		  address: this will start the auxiliary core at the address
		         which is given in the transfer parameter.

		Example:  "echo start > bootaux", "echo pause > bootaux",
		          "echo stop > bootaux", "echo reset > bootaux",
		          "echo run > bootaux", "echo 0x7f8000 > bootaux"

The file/programm have the following read/write attributes:

    /sys/devices/system/cpu/aux_core

	"mem" ... read:
	      read the last file/programm which you have loaded
	      Example: "cat mem" -> hello_world.bin

	      ... write:
	      write the file/programm which you want to load. Attention:
	      you have to set an absolut path. No relative paths are allowed.
	      Example: "echo /root/hello_world.bin > mem"

The address have the following read/write attributes:

    /sys/devices/system/cpu/aux_core

    	"mem_addr" ... read:
		   reads the address were the file/programm will be started.
		   Default is the tcm.
		   Example: "cat mem_addr" -> 0x7f8000

    	           ... write:
    	           write the address were the file/programm will be stored.
    	           Example: "echo 0x7f8000 > mem_addr"
